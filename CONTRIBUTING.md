Quality Assurance

One of the most useful tasks, closely related to triage, is finding and filing bug reports. Testing
beta releases, looking for regressions, creating test cases, adding to our test suites, and

that increase our test coverage, writing tests for issues others have filed, all these tasks
are really valuable contributions to open source projects.
